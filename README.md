**It's always important to put README files in any GitHub project.**
You should put a brief description of what this repository is/was used for.
In the future, when you stumble upon this repository, the README will help refresh your memory.

1. When creating a README file remember to add the ".md" as the file type.
2. .md files use a language called markdown; which allows you to use inline HTML or just type plain text.
3. Here's the link to markdown syntax https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
4. It is also important to use the README file by updating it with path decisions and important "about" information.
5. README files are the only files in your repository that use capital letters..
